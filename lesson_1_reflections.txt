How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Viewing a diff highlighted just the parts that were different and helps identify the bug


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can roll back to find when a bug was introduced.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: logical checkpoints
Cons: might forget to commit often, leading to bundling of distinct changes


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Code commonly requires changes to multiple files for 1 logical change.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

just use it? and use / to search. and remember that the start of the hash is sufficient. (5 chars usually is more than enough) use q to quit, w for previous, space and enter for next


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

we can always go back to the work version with git checkout


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

no idea man
